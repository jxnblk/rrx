## API

### `createRouter`

Higher order component to create a wrapper Router component.
This component creates a [history](https://npmjs.com/package/history) object and provides context for both `history` and `location`.

Router components provide these objects through context:

- `history` - the history object from [history](https://npmjs.com/package/history)
- `location` - the location object from [history](https://npmjs.com/package/history)

### `createView`

Creates a view component that accepts a `pattern` prop for route matching. If the location matches the pattern, the component will render with `params` and `search` props. If it does not match, it will not render.

View component props:
- `pattern` - a URL pattern to match against. Uses [path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp)

Props provided by the HOC:

- `params` - object of URL parameters from the given `pattern`.
- `search` - the `location.search` string

### `createLink`

Creates a Link component that uses the history context to transition between routes using the browser History API.

### Base Components

In addition to the higher order components, each is available as a base component â€“ though these are generally less convenient to use for the Router and views.

```js
import {
  Router,
  View,
  Link
} from 'rrx'
```
